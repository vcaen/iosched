Android Dev Summit app (ADSSched)
======================
The Android Dev Summit app (adssched) is a fork of the Google I/O app (iosched) and was used as the official conference app for the Android Dev Summit in November 2018, held in Mountain View, California.

Read IOSched's [README](https://github.com/google/iosched) for a general description of the features and architecture.

This project is the Android app for the conference. The app supports devices
running Android 5.0+, and is optimized for phones and tablets of all shapes
and sizes.


The source code in this repository reflects the app as of I/O 2017.
